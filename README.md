In quantum optical experiments, especially in thoses involve cold atoms, the quality of the optical pumping preparation of the atomic states is key to a clear demonstration of the core physics. This numerical simulation provides some insight on how the pumping quality is dependent on various pumping parameters, such as pumping Rabi frequency, pumping duration.

The simulation use QuTiP to solve the master equation of the atomic system. The quantum jump operator associated with atomic spontaneous emission is the only Lindblad operator in this model.
